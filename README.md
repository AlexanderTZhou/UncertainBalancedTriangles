# Arguments

argv[0] = ./baltri

argv[1] = Process Number

  *	1 : Baseline Counting
  *	2 : Improved Counting
  *	3 : vBase
  *	4 : vImpr
  *	5 : eBase
  *	6 : eImpr

argv[2] = Edge File in tsv format (int \t int \t Positive Sign Probability)

argv[3] = t value

  * Between 0 and 1
 
argv[4] = Number of Samples (Process 3-6 only)

When executing the code, there may be slight incorrect calculations that occur due to floating point arithmetic.
